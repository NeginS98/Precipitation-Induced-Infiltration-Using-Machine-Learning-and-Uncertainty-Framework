# Groundwater Infiltration Trend Analysis 
This repository includes data processing and modeling for estimating precipitation-induced groundwater infiltration trends in an specific area. 

## Overview
The project applies various machine learning models to evaluate historical (1987â€“2017) and future (CMIP6) infiltration trends. The analysis includes:
- ** Evapotranspiration estimation** the Thornthwaite method.
- ** Water balance components** calculated via Theissen and Kriging interpolation.
- ** Bias correction** of CMIP6 climate model outputs.
- ** Monte Carlo analysis** to select the most reliable model for each sub-basin.


* In my original coding notebook, part of modeling was a bit different from what I uploaded in here as the process was almost the same.
